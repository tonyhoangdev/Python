print "+, -, *, /, %, (** exponent, // floor division)" + '\n'


## Comparison Operators
print "=== Comparison Operators ==="
print ">, >=, <, <=, ==, != or <>" + '\n'


## Assignment Operators
print "=== Assignment Operators ==="
print "=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=" + '\n'


## Logical Operators
print "=== Logical Operators ==="
print "and, or, not" + '\n'


## Bitwise Operators
print "=== Bitwise Operators ==="
print "&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>" + '\n'


## Membership Operators
print "=== Membership Operators ==="
print "in, not in" + '\n'


## Identity Operators (compare the memory locations of two objects)
print "=== Identity Operators ==="
print "is, is not" + '\n'
